      <p>With my experience of working as a freelancer, I decided to start my own IT consultancy firm. It started as just a professional website for my freelancing services but with time it expanded into a firm that I can be proud of. Currently socialrabbit.Inc mainly focuses on providing aid to companies that are in need of different IT services including but not limited to Management, design and development and security auditing. While working in socialrabbit.Inc I developed and released a simple social networking platform and an application. During the run, we developed a social networking service built in PHP.</p>
